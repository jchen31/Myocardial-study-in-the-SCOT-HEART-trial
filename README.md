This repository contains code primarily developed in Python and R. It includes implementations for:
1.	LVM segmentation
2.	Radiomics feature extraction
3.	Multivariable regression models
4.	Univariable and multivariable Cox regression models
5.	Cumulative distribution function (CDF) models
6.	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and eigen-feature modeling
7.	Likelihood ratio test (LRT) models
8.	Time-dependent C-statistics models
The codebase supports the full analysis pipeline from image processing to advanced statistical modeling.
